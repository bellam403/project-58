        <hr>
        <p>PJ Masks (French: Pyjamasques) is a French-British interactive computer-animated superhero children's television series produced by Frog Box, Entertainment One UK Limited, Walt Disney EMEA Productions Limited and TeamTO, with the participation of France Télévisions and Disney Junior. The series is based on the Les Pyjamasques book series by Romuald Racioppo.[2] Disney Channels Worldwide's Disney Junior channels broadcast PJ Masks worldwide, while France 5 airs the series in its original home country of France; it also airs on Tiny Pop in the UK, ABC Kids in Australia, RAI YoYo in Italy, TV Cultura in Brazil, and Televisa in Mexico.

            The series debuted on Disney Junior in the United States on September 18, 2015,[3] on France 5 on December 18, 2015 and on Disney Junior in Canada on February 7, 2016. In June 2016, a second season was announced;[4] it began airing on 15 January 2018. On April 19, 2019, the first episode of the third season was aired. The fourth season was announced to air in April 2020[5][6], but instead it aired on May 15, 2020[7][8], possibly due to the COVID-19 pandemic which reduced Entertainment One's produced/acquired television half-hour content from 339 (2019) to 276 (2020) for the second quarter.[9]. As early as January 2020, PJ Masks was renewed for a fifth season forecast to be aired in 2021[10][11], with production shooting already scheduled between April 1, 2020 to April 1, 2021[12].

            On December 30, 2019, Hasbro acquired Entertainment One for a $3.8 billion deal,[13] making the series the first Disney Junior show to be under the ownership of Hasbro, even though Just Play still makes toys for the show.</p>
